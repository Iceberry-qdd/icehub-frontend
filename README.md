A social networking site. The repository is the front-end repository.
</div>

## Instruction
Icehub (Iceberry's social hub) is a twitter-like social networking site I created. The front-end project uses [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/core) as the development framework, with minimal use of other third-party libraries, and you can host it yourself if you wish.

## Build
You can build from source code like this:

### Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

> [!NOTE]
> For production builds, create a new file called `.env.production` with the same contents as the [.env.development](./.env.development) file or configure the key-value pairs yourself.

## Todo
Below are some of the features that are in the works or planned for the near future, a full list is detailed in the [Icehub-frontend v1.0 plan](https://github.com/users/Iceberry-qdd/projects/2):
